This project involves using survey data to conduct conjoint analysis and cluster analysis on the respondent to study the preferences and customer profile within each group.  Each survey respondent are clustered into specific profile group based on similarity of their responses to the survey questions.   Each group is then further characterized based on their preference over particular characteristics of a CPU, particularly the major brands AMD and Intel
